This React project is a compilation of various experiments with [ag-grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/). 

Start up the site by running `npm start` and then click the links in the left-nav to see the following working examples, each with a separate proof-of-concept featuring ag-grid:
* Basic ag-grid with React, demonstrates:
    * Fetching and loading data from external API
    * onGridReady callback, use of gridApi
    * Column mapping using columnDefs property
    * Multiple row selection using rowSelection="multiple" attribute on grid, checkboxSelection:true in columnDefs
    
* Triggering a Material-UI popover when clicking inside an ag-grid cell

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
